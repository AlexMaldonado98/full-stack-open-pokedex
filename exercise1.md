my choice was the python language analyzing the first point I can see that the steps to cover the linting, testing and build phase is to use technology like Pylint for linting, Unittest for testing and Tetuptools for building.
For the second point we can use Gitlab CI/CD apart from the Github actions and Jenkins .
As previously said, everything depends on our needs, since both options have their advantages and disadvantages.
